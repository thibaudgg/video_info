        Wine in Kettering (Episode 4)","description":"The Century of the Self is an
        award-winning British television documentary series by Adam Curtis. It focuses
        on how the work of Sigmund Freud, Anna Freud, and Edward Bernays influenced
        the way corporations and governments have analyzed,\u202d dealt with, and
        controlled \u202cpeople.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n\"This series is about how those
        in power have used Freud''s theories to try and control the dangerous crowd
        in an age of mass democracy.\" \u2014Adam Curtis'' introduction to the first
        episode.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nSigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, changed
        the perception of the human mind and its workings. The series describes the
        propaganda that Western governments and corporations have utilized stemming
        from Freud''s theories.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nFreud himself and his nephew Edward
        Bernays, who was the first to use psychological techniques in public relations,
        are discussed. Freud''s daughter Anna Freud, a pioneer of child psychology,
        is mentioned in the second part, as is one of the main opponents of Freud''s
        theories, Wilhelm Reich, in the third part.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nAlong these general
        themes, The Century of the Self asks deeper questions about the roots and
        methods of modern consumerism, representative democracy, commodification and
        its implications. It also questions the modern way we see ourselves, the attitudes
        to fashion and superficiality.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nThe business and political
        world uses psychological techniques to read, create and fulfill our desires,
        to make their products or speeches as pleasing as possible to us. Curtis raises
        the question of the intentions and roots of this fact. Where once the political
        process was about engaging people''s rational, conscious minds, as well as
        facilitating their needs as a society, the documentary shows how by employing
        the tactics of psychoanalysis, politicians appeal to irrational, primitive
        impulses that have little apparent bearing on issues outside of the narrow
        self-interest of a consumer population.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nPaul Mazur, a leading
        Wall Street banker working for Lehman Brothers, is cited as declaring: \"We
        must shift America from a needs- to a desires-culture. People must be trained
        to desire, to want new things, even before the old have been entirely consumed.
        [...] Man''s desires must overshadow his needs\".<br \/>\n<br \/>\nIn Episode
        4 the main subjects are Philip Gould and Matthew Freud, the great-grandson
        of Sigmund, a PR consultant. They were part of the efforts during the nineties
        to bring the Democrats in the US and New Labour in the United Kingdom back
        into power. Adam Curtis explores the psychological methods they have now massively
        introduced into politics. He also argues that the eventual outcome strongly
        resembles Edward Bernays vision for the \"Democracity\" during the 1939 New
        York World''s Fair. It is widely believed that the series was inspired and
        informed by a book written by the American historian, Stuart Ewen, \"PR! A
        Social History of Spin\"","url":"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/70388245","upload_date":"2013-07-16
